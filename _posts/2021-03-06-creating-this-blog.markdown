GitHub Pages is a great free service from github that allows anyone to create a static website like this and host it for free. Using the Jekyll static site generator, alongside a theme I created the framework for this blog in just a few minutes. I'm sure the content will take a lot longer! 
That is part of the appeal of using a static site generator to create this, as opposed to a more complex system like WordPress. There isnt much upkeep involved here, and the necessary setup is very easy.

### GitHub
If you don't already have a github account, you are going to need one to make use of github pages. Head over to [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account. Your account username will be used to create the initial github pages address, like [vampyrbyte.github.io](https://vampyrbyte.github.io). but we can change this later.
